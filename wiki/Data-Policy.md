### Permissions
Here are the permissions *Prophets of the Labyrinth* asks for and a summary of what they'll be used for:
- Send Messages: PotL responds to commands and game state changes in text channels
- Create Private Threads: Dungeon delves are done in private threads to avoid spamming non-players
- Send Messages in Threads: PotL sends game updates in dungeon delve threads
- Manage Messages: Game state changes sometimes necessitate message editing and clean-up
- Pin Messages: UI and controls information are pinned in delve threads
- Embed Links: PotL refers users to its github for documentation and feedback
- Attach Files: Overflowing messages (such as the full patch notes) are attached as text files
